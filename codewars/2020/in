In a 2017 German study, researchers at Ruhr-University Bochum compared the ability of gamers  and  non-gamers  to  remember  information  from  cue  cards  and  then  combine  that  information to predict weather conditions. The video gamers showed greater retention of the  cue  card  knowledge  and  made  better  predictions,  especially  in  conditions  of  uncertainty.
